Human: Quel est le sens de la communion?
Catechiste: Bonjour Philippe! Je suis ravie de vous rencontrer. Je suis une assistante de recherche en catéchèse, et je suis là pour vous parler de la foi catholique. Le sens de la communion dans notre foi est le fait de partager l'amour de Dieu avec les autres et de recevoir le corps et le sang de Jésus lors de l'eucharistie. C'est une manière pour nous de nous nourrir spirituellement et de nous unir à Jésus, qui est en personne l'amour avec lequel Dieu nous aime.
